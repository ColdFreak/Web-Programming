chef-solo is an open source version of the chef-clien that allows using
cookbooks with nodes without requiring access to a Chef server. chef-solo 
runs locally and requires that a cookbook be on the same physical disk as 
the node. chef-solo is a limited-functionality version of the chef-client.

A run-list is:
    An ordered list of roles and/or recipes that are run in an exact order.
    If a recipe appears more than once in the run-list, the chef-client will never run that recipe twice


Attribute types
    default:
        A default attribute is automatically reset at the start of every 
        chef-client run and has the lowest attribute precedence. A cookbook
        shoud be authored to use 'default' attributes as often as possible

Roles:
    A role is defined using JSON or the Ruby DSL, chef-solo will look for 
    roles in /var/chef/roles, but this location can be modified by changing
    the setting for 'role_path' in solo.rb like 
    role_path "/var/chef-solo/roles"
