A run-list is:
    An ordered list of roles and/or recipes that are run in an exact order.
    If a recipe appears more than once in the run-list, the chef-client will never run that recipe twice


Attribute types
    default:
        A default attribute is automatically reset at the start of every 
        chef-client run and has the lowest attribute precedence. A cookbook
        shoud be authored to use 'default' attributes as often as possible
